## My process

I divided the project into different sections and slowly built it up. First I made a git repository, then I wrote all the html code and later I added a css file and added external css to the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This is my first ever project so I learned a lot about the workflow of a project. From initialising a project to commiting changes in git bash, I understood how I can make better commits and have a smooth workflow. I also learned about a css property called transform. I didn't know anything about this property, but when I got stuck at a point, I went to stack overflow to find some answers and I found out about the transform property.

### Continued development

I definitely want to learn more about the transform property and more properties which I found out on the mdn page for the transform property. I also want to understand element positioning in css better.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4687923/how-to-center-a-div-from-top-to-bottom) - This page helped me in understanding how I can center a div vertically on a webpage.
- [resource 2] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) - This article helped me understand how the transform property works.
